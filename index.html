        <p> Turtles date back to more than 200 years ago, older than most dinosaurs!</p>
        <h4> All shapes and sizes </h4>
        <p> There are more than 300 species of turtles, the largest being the leatherback turtle and the smallest being the speckled padloper tortoise, weighing a measly 165g</p>
        <h4> How long can they stay under water? </h4>
        <p> Believe it or not, turtles can stay under the water for more than five hours!</p>
        <h4> How do they drink? </h4>
        <p> Turtles have special glands in their bodies which seperate the salt from water when they drink! </p>
        <h4> Shells </h4>
        <p> Turtles also have a lower shell called a 'plastron'</p>
        <h4> Can all turtles retract their bodies?</h4>
        <p> Contrast to popular beliefs,  not all turtles can retract their heads, and, those who do, can only do so at varying degrees. </p>
